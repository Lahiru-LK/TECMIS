TECMIS - Information Management System

üë• Our dynamic team, comprising of talented individuals - Dhananjaya Rupasinghe, Buddhi Sampath,@Prageeth Siriwardhana, and myself - is excited to present our second-year Java mini project: TECMIS, an Information Management System. This project is a testament to our commitment to Object-Oriented Programming (#oop ) principles, utilizing the #javafx #frameworks for an intuitive user interface, seamlessly integrated into the IntelliJ IDEA environment. To ensure efficient data management, we harnessed the power of #mysql as our database management tool. Our collaboration was streamlined through #github , enhancing our #teamwork throughout this #project's lifecycle.

#TECMIS streamlines administrative processes and fosters collaboration across multiple user categories, including administrators, lecturers, students, and technical officers. üí° With an array of features such as enrollment #management, organized course materials, and personalized dashboards, #TECMIS revolutionizes the university experience. üåê Leveraging #javafx, we prioritized data privacy and security, delivering a seamless and safeguarded solution.
